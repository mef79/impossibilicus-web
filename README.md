# proj

We have a board: to see it, go here to install ZenHub: https://www.zenhub.com/

## Requirements
- Install `node` and `npm` - [Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

## Starting the app
- Clone the repo
- Copy `sample.env` to `.env` (this sets the environment variables used - default is a locally running `proj-api` instance, hosted address available on Heroku)
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the app - it will be running at http://localhost:3000
- (That's all)
